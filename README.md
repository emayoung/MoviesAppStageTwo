The project has been optimised to scroll through the movie list without any slag whatsover thanks to [ButterKnife](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife ) and [Implementing Parcelables](http://www.techdepo.com.ng/2017/04/popular-movie-app-stage1-udacity.html) 

A little tricky logic has been applied to correctly resize the movies appearing to show 4 equally mapped movie posters no matter your screen size and for tables it can show more depending on the screen size
